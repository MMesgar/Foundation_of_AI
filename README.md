#  Foundations of AI - Lectures Summer Semester 2022

This repository contains the materials I use for the course ```Foundations of AI``` at the University of Duisburg-Essen. 
This is a bachelor course. The course is deisigned to be indpendent from other course in computer science. However, some basic knowledge of data strutures, algorithm design, and basics of a programming language would help students. 

This course is taught by [Mohsen Mesgar](https://mohsen-mesgar.io).
